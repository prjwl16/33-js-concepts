// An expression is a piece of code that produces a value.
// It can be as simple as a literal value (e.g., 5, "Hello"), a variable, or a more complex combination of operators and operands.
// For example:
2 + 3;

// A statement is a piece of code that performs some action.
// For example:
console.log(2 + 3);

//All

var x = 5; // Variable declaration and assignment statement
if (x > 3) {
  // If statement
  console.log("x is greater than 3");
}
